# Advance-Q-A-ChatBot
Advance Q/A ChatBot, using Langchain, Groq API, Streamlit

This code is a Streamlit application that demonstrates the usage of the LangChain library for building a question-answering system using the Groq language model. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Imports: The necessary libraries and modules are imported, including Streamlit for the web interface, LangChain components for document loading, text processing, embeddings, and the FAISS vector store.
Environment Variables: The dotenv package is used to load environment variables, specifically the Groq API key needed to access the Groq model.
Session State Initialization: The code checks if a session state variable named "vector" exists. If not, it initializes several components:
OllamaEmbeddings: This is used for generating embeddings from the text.
WebBaseLoader: This loads documents from a specified URL, in this case, the LangChain documentation.
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: This splits the loaded documents into smaller chunks for processing.
FAISS: This creates a vector store from the document embeddings for efficient retrieval.
Streamlit Interface: The title of the app is set to "ChatGroq Demo".
A ChatGroq instance is created using the loaded API key and a specified model name ("mixtral-8x7b-32768").
A prompt template is defined to structure the questions and context for the model.

Retrieval Chain:
A document chain is created to process the input and generate responses based on the retrieved documents.
A retriever is created from the FAISS vector store, which will be used to find relevant documents based on user queries.

User Input:
A text input field is provided for users to enter their questions.
When a question is submitted, the application measures the time taken to generate a response using the retrieval chain and displays the answer.
Document Similarity Search:

An expander is included in the interface that shows the relevant documents that were used to generate the answer. Each document's content is displayed along with a separator for clarity.
Overall, this code creates an interactive web application that allows users to ask questions based on the content loaded from a specified URL, leveraging a language model for processing and answering those questions. :User Can you provide an example of how to use this code?

You: To use this Streamlit application, follow these steps:

Set Up Environment:
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the required libraries by running:
bash
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
pip install streamlit langchain python-dotenv faiss-cpu
Create a .env File:

In the same directory as your code, create a .env file and add your Groq API key:
Insert Code
Edit
Copy code
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Run the Application:

Save the provided code in a Python file, for example, app.py.
Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing app.py, and run:
bash
Copy code:-
streamlit run app.py

Interact with the App:
Once the application is running, it will open in your web browser.
You will see the title "ChatGroq Demo" and a text input field.
Enter your question related to the LangChain documentation or any other content you have loaded.
After submitting your question, the app will process it and display the answer along with the relevant documents used for generating the response.
Explore Document Similarity:

You can expand the section that shows the relevant documents to see which parts of the content were used to formulate the answer.
This example demonstrates how to set up and use the Streamlit application to interact with the Groq language model for question answering.
